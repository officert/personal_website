####Find & Show Wi-Fi Network Passwords from the Command Line in OS X     

Using this you can find the password for a wireless network you have
previously connected to.

```
security find-generic-password -ga "ROUTERNAME" | grep "password:"
```

For example my home wireless network is called 'workshp'.

```
security find-generic-password -ga wrkshp | grep "password:"
```

would give me an output of

```
password: <wifi password here>
```
