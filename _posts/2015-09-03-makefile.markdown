##Using PHONY
A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file; rather it is just a name for a recipe to be executed when you make an explicit request. There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with a file of the same name, and to improve performance.

{% highlight bash %}
.PHONY: build
{% endhighlight %}

if you have a directory 'build' make will try and execute that directory, so add that target to .PHONY
